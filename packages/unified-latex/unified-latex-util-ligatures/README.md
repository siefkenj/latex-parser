# Functions

## `createMatchers()`



```typescript
function createMatchers(): { isMacro: (node: any) => node is Ast.Macro; isWhitespace: (node: any) => node is Ast.Whitespace; isRecognized: (nodes: Ast.Node[], whitespaceAllowed?: boolean) => Ast.String; isSplitable: (node: Ast.Node) => boolean; split: (node: Ast.String) => { ...; }[]; }
```

## `parseLigatures(ast)`

Parse for recognized ligatures like `---` and `\:o`, etc. These are
replaced with string nodes with the appropriate unicode character subbed in.

```typescript
function parseLigatures(ast: Ast.Node[]): Ast.Node[];
```

**Parameters**

| Param | Type         |
| :---- | :----------- |
