# unified-latex-util-render-info

## What is this?

Functions to help modify the `_renderInfo` of a `unified-latex` Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

## When should I use this?

If you want to compare the structure of an AST without position information or extra information
that is kept for pretty-printing, these functions can be used to remove/modify the `_renderInfo`
of an `Ast.Node`.

# Functions

## `trimRenderInfo(ast)`

Removes any `_renderInfo` and `position` tags present in the AST. This
operation is *destructive*.

```typescript
function trimRenderInfo(ast: Ast.Ast): Ast.Ast;
```

**Parameters**

| Param | Type      |
| :---- | :-------- |
| ast   | `Ast.Ast` |

## `updateRenderInfo(node, renderInfo)`

Updates the `._renderInfo` property on a node to include
whatever has been supplied to `renderInfo`. If `renderInfo`
is null, no update is performed.

*This operation mutates `node`*

```typescript
function updateRenderInfo(node: Ast.Node, renderInfo: {}): Ast.Node;
```

**Parameters**

| Param      | Type       |
| :--------- | :--------- |
| node       | `Ast.Node` |
| renderInfo | `{}`       |
