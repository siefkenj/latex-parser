# unified-latex-prettier

## What is this?

A [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) plugin for formatting and pretty-printing LaTeX source code.

## When should I use this?

If you want to construct a `Prettier` instance that has LaTeX parsing abilities.

You should probably use the `prettier-plugin-latex` package instead of directly accessing this package.
