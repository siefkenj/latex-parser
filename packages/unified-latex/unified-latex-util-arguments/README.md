# unified-latex-util-arguments

## What is this?

Functions to help modify and attach arguments to macros in a `unified-latex` Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

By default, TeX doesn't actually have a concept of macro "arguments". Instead, TeX searches the
tokens after a macro and processes them according to the macro's rules. However, LaTeX attempts
to make macros look like functions that accept arguments. To attach the "arguments" to a macro
node, the `unified-latex` AST needs to be reparsed and manipulated.

## When should I use this?

If you have custom macros that you want arguments attached to.

If you know ahead of time which macros need arguments attached to them, use `unified-latex-util-parse`
and pass in the appropriate macro info instead.

# Plugins

## `unifiedLatexAttachMacroArguments`

Unified plugin to attach macro arguments to the macros specified via the `macros`
option.

### Usage

`unified().use(unifiedLatexAttachMacroArguments[, options])`

#### options

```typescript
{ macros: Ast.MacroInfoRecord; }
```

### Type

`Plugin<{ macros: Ast.MacroInfoRecord; }[], Ast.Root, Ast.Root>`

```typescript
function unifiedLatexAttachMacroArguments(options: {
  macros: Ast.MacroInfoRecord;
}): (tree: Ast.Root) => void;
```

# Functions

## `getArgsContent(node)`

Returns the content of `args` for a macro or environment as an array. If an argument
was omitted (e.g., because it was an optional arg that wasn't included), then `null` is returned.

```typescript
function getArgsContent(node: Ast.Macro | Ast.Environment): Ast.Node[][];
```

**Parameters**

| Param | Type                           |
| :---- | :----------------------------- |
| node  | `Ast.Macro \| Ast.Environment` |
